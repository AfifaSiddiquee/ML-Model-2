# Sentiment Analysis Web App 

## Overview  
This is a **Sentiment Analysis Web Application** built using **Logistic Regression** and **TF-IDF Vectorizer**. It analyzes **user reviews or text inputs** to determine whether the sentiment is **positive, negative, or neutral**.  

The app is designed to help businesses, researchers, and individuals understand how customers feel about a product, service, or topic based on text data.  

The model was trained on a dataset containing reviews and was **deployed using Streamlit Cloud**, making it easily accessible via a web interface.

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- **Real-time Sentiment Prediction:** Users can enter text, and the model instantly classifies it as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.  
- **Machine Learning Model:** The app utilizes a **Logistic Regression model** trained on customer reviews.  
- **Text Preprocessing:** The input text is cleaned using techniques such as **lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stopword removal** before being converted into a numerical format.  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** The app uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert text into numerical features, making it suitable for model predictions.  
- **Easy Deployment & Accessibility:** Hosted on **Streamlit Cloud**, making it accessible from any device with an internet connection.  
- **Interactive & User-Friendly UI:** Simple and clean interface for seamless user interaction.
